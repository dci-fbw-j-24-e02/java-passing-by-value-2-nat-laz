## Exercise: Incrementing a Number

### Objective:
The objective of this exercise is to practice creating a program that demonstrates the concept of pass by value by incrementing an integer variable within a method. This exercise will help you understand how changes to parameters within a method do not affect the original variables.

### Instructions:

#### Prompt for Input:
- Write a program that prompts the user to enter an integer value.
- Store this value in an integer variable.

#### Create an Increment Method:
- Implement a method named increment that takes an integer parameter.
- Inside this method, increment the value of the parameter by 1. Note that this method should only modify the copy of the parameter and not the original variable passed by the user.
- This method should not return any values.

#### Display the Original and Incremented Values:
- After calling the increment method, display the original value to show that it has not been changed.
- Also, display the incremented value as it was modified within the method.

#### Run the Program:
- Run the program and verify the output.
